Hi guys here are some instructions in case you need help

IMPORTANT for these steps make sure you cd into my-app

- clone repo
- open on text editor (prob vscode)
- make sure u have node.js install
- open up powershell or terminal and run npm install --legacy-peer-deps should      install all needed dependencies in package.json that i have set up
- running npm start will open up metro
- install expo on app store to view app



If these fail

- incase these dont work, try manually installing expo, but the npm install --legacy-peer-deps should work
- documentation: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
- NOTE: we ARE using the expo cli
